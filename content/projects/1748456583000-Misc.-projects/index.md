Here are a few smaller projects that I've worked on over the years.
- 2021: [Surveybot](https://github.com/Epicotch/EISC-Surveybot), a discord bot to track "anomalies" in [Starscape](https://www.roblox.com/games/679715583/Starscape-Beta).
- 2025: [MASLAB team 7](https://maslab.mit.edu/2025/wiki/team07), aka "Ricky and the Rizzlers". I helped design our arm and claws, as well as program some of the autonomouse cube seeking.
